# Spring Async Thread Issue


Recently, I faced major issue in production related to Spring Async. Creating this repo to make that developer understand how to use Spring Async and why in Async method you can not get HTTP request.

Without understanding the consequences, he added Async annotation at multiple places with the intention to parallelly execute the threads.

Hope, He understands the concept and will be a great developer one day!
